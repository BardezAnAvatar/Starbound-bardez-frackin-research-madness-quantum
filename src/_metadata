This is for the bad sci-fi trope of calling things \"quantum\" to hand-wave an explanation.\n    [list]\n     [*]To elaborate further: this is a node for FUN whacky things, and made in good fun. This is the madness tree, after all.\n    [/list]\n  [/list]\n[/list]\n\n\n\n[b]Boring Stuff:[/b]\n[url=https://github.com/BardezAnAvatar/Starbound-bardez-frackin-research-madness-quantum]Source on GitHub[/url]\n\n[b]Attributions[/b]\n- Atom icon appropriated from [url=https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Physics-Beginners-Understanding-Explanation-ebook/dp/B08YXNC9BT]Quantum Physics for Beginners[/url] by Carl J.
